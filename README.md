## About this notes
All notes and code was written in the Jupyter Notebook environment. You can render all `*.ipynb` notebooks without 
running a local server, GitHub works _somewhat_ fine to you. Also, for best experience, you can download the files and use [Jupyter/IPython 
notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
