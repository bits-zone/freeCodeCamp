## About this notes
All notes and code was written in the Jupyter Notebook environment. You can render all `*.ipynb` notebooks without 
running at local server, GitHub works _somewhat_ fine to you. Alternatively, you can access the [links above](#Certifications) to see the correspondent notebook online in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Also, for best experience, you can download the files and use [Jupyter/IPython notebook](https://jupyter.org/) in your local machine.
