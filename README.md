## About this notes
All notes and codes was written in the Jupyter Notebook environment. You can render all `*.ipynb` notebooks without 
running at local server, GitHub works _somewhat_ fine to you. Alternatively, you can access [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Also, for best experience, you can download the files and use [Jupyter/IPython notebook](https://jupyter.org/) in your local machine.
